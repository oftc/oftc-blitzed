Here's a (surely incomplete) list of things that wrecked or other services
have that our services do not, which we MAY wish to implement:

GENERAL

- An overhaul of command line options is needed, probably with getopt, and
  decisions made on what can be set at runtime or only at compile time.

- Batch mode changes.

- Autoconf test for MySQL *VERSION* - we need 4.x at the moment.

- Don't let any of the FORBID commands work on an already forbidden
  nick/chan.


NICKSERV

- SET WATCHACCESS, any time a user's chanlist is modified send them a
  notice telling them that their access has been added/changed/deleted.

- Merge ghost/regain/recover/release into as few commands as possible.

- INFO to show whether ENFORCE or QUICK ENFORCE is set, but to owner only.
  From Taras.

- Add AutoPromote nick setting.  When enabled, this will op/voice (whichever is
  the highest access they have) the user in every channel they are in every
  time they IDENTIFY.

- Add optional NOJOIN and NOPROMOTE flags on the end of the NickServ IDENTIFY
  command to disable the effect of AUtoJoin and AutoPromote nick options on
  that IDENTIFY.


CHANSERV

- HOSTMSG command suggested by Crappy and specced by strtok in:

  http://lists.blitzed.org/pipermail/public/2001-July/000069.html

- Channel option for ban mask type.  When a user matches an AKICK mask and
  bantype is set, the mask will be constructed based on that type rather than
  what is in the AKICK list.  This will allow AKICKs to be matched by ident for
  example, but placed only on the full hostname.

- MARK/UNMARK as for nicks.

- Send a notice to user upon REGISTER with a URL showing them all the cool
  things they can now do with a channel.

- Services Admins CURRENTLY can:
    - view channel access lists
    - view AND MODIFY (!!!!) channel akick lists
    - change channel settings
    - set noexpire
    - change levels settings

  at will with no form of globops, log message or warning to the user.  We
  should look into restricting some or all of these abilities down to the
  bare minimum required for support purposes.

- Extra syntax for ACCESS DEL/LIST:

    ACCESS LIST <16

  to list every access entry below 16.  Is this idea better done with a web
  interface?

- Optional penis enlarging wallops when registered channels passes certain
  boundaries.

- New command to op or voice (depending on their highest access) every
  user in a specific channel.  Can anyone suggest a name?

- Have ChanServ send a notice to a channel on (un)register.  The (un)setting of
  cmode r was the only way users could tell this had happened, and we no longer
  use cmode r so now they have no way to know.


MEMOSERV

ircservices MEMOSERV actually has more features than wrecked/magick's.
Still a couple of things however:

- FORWARD to forward an individual memo to another person.

- REPLY, which writes a memo back to sender with the prefix "[REPLY]"

- Services Admins CURRENTLY can:
    - View & change limits on user & channel memo box size
    - View memo info for any user (but strangely, not channels)

  at will with no form of globops, log message or warning to the user.  We
  should look into restricting some or all of these abilities down to the
  bare minimum required for support.

- All memos currently go to the master nick, but when reading memos it reads
  from the current nick.  Memos should always be read from master nick.


OPERSERV

- Add an "override" command that sets a flag on the services admin's ni.
  All the routines that deop, akick etc., should check for this flag.  If it is
  present these routines will send a globops saying what they would do, instead
  of doing it.

- Need to add the nick of the person who added OPERNEWS, at least in the GLOBOPS.

- Should probably do a GLOBOPS when OPERNEWS is deleted.

- Manipulation of AKILL list by number as well as mask.

- IGNORE, tell services to ignore people

- REHASH, reread services.conf without SQUITting (have a feeling this will be
  hard).  Maybe this is now better done by working out how to stop services
  mass-op/voicing everyone when it starts?  Without the mass-op/voice, users
  probably would not be able to tell that services has restarted.

- Before an akill is placed for session limiting, display some details
  about which channels the clients were in.

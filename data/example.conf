# $Id$
# Example configuration file for Services.  After making the appropriate
# changes to this file, place it in the Services data directory (as
# specified in the "configure" script, default /usr/local/lib/services)
# under the name "services.conf".
#
# The format of this file is fairly simple: a line beginning with a # is a
# comment, and any other non-blank line is expected to be a directive and
# parameters, separated by spaces or tabs.  For example:
#
#	Directive Parameter-1 Parameter-2 ...
#
# Directives are case-insensitive.  Note that some directives do not take
# any parameters; these are typically "on-off" directives, for which simply
# including the directive in this file (or removing it) has an effect on
# Services' functionality.
#
# If a parameter's value is a string which includes spaces, enclose the
# string in double quotation marks, like the example below.  Quotes may be
# used around any string at all for clarity.
#
#	"This is a parameter string with spaces in it"
#
# If you need to include a double quote inside a quoted string, precede it
# by a backslash:
#
#	"This string has \"double quotes\" in it"
#
# Time parameters can be specified either as an integer representing a
# number of seconds (e.g. "3600" = 1 hour), or as an integer with a unit
# specifier: "s" = seconds, "m" = minutes, "h" = hours, "d" = days.
# Combinations (such as "1h30m") are not permitted.  Examples (all of which
# represent the same length of time, one day):
#
#	"86400", "86400s", "1440m", "24h", "1d"
#
# In the documentation for each directive, one of the following will be
# included to indicate whether an option is required:
#
# [REQUIRED]
#     Indicates a directive which must be given.  Without it, Services will
#     not start.
#
# [RECOMMENDED]
#     Indicates a directive which may be omitted, but omitting it may cause
#     undesirable side effects.
#
# [OPTIONAL]
#     Indicates a directive which is optional.  If not given, the feature
#     will typically be disabled.  If this is not the case, more
#     information will be given in the documentation.
#
# [DISCOURAGED]
#     Indicates a directive which may cause undesirable side effects if
#     specified.
#
# [DEPRECATED]
#     Indicates a directive which will disappear in a future version of
#     Services, usually because its functionality has been either
#     superseded by that of other directives or incorporated into the main
#     program.

# Remote server configuration
#
###########################################################################

# RemoteServer <hostname> <port> <password>  [REQUIRED]
#     Specifies the remote server hostname and port.  The hostname may
#     either be a standard Internet hostname or dotted-quad numeric
#     address; the port number must be an integer between 1 and 65535
#     inclusive.  The password is a string which should be enclosed in
#     double quotes if it contains any spaces (or just for clarity).
#
#     The remote server and port may be overridden at runtime with the
#     -remote command-line option.  The password may not be set at runtime.

RemoteServer	localhost 6667 "mypass"

# LocalAddress <hostname> [port]  [OPTIONAL]
#     Specifies the local address to bind to before connecting to the
#     remote server.  This may be useful on multihomed hosts.  The hostname
#     and port number are specified the same way as with the RemoteServer
#     directive.  If this is not specified, Services will let the operating
#     system choose the local address.  If only a hostname is specified,
#     Services will bind to that address but let the operating system
#     choose the local port number.
#
#     If you don't know what this means or don't need to use it, just leave
#     the directive commented out.

#    will be assumed. 

#MySQLPort 13306

# MySQLSocket <socket path>  [OPTIONAL]
#    Full path to MySQL unix socket, used when talking to MySQL server on

# Basic functionality
#
###########################################################################

# NoBackupOkay  [DISCOURAGED]
#     Allows Services to continue file write operations (i.e. database
#     saving) even if the original file cannot be backed up.  Enabling this
#     option may allow Services to continue operation under some conditions
#     when it might otherwise fail, such as a nearly-full disk.
#
#     *** NOTE ***
#     Enabling this option can cause irrecoverable data loss under some
#     conditions, so make CERTAIN you know what you're doing when you
#     enable it!

#NoBackupOkay

# NoSplitRecovery [OPTIONAL]
#     Disables Services' recognition of users returning from netsplits.
#     Normally (on networks with some sort of timestamp support in the IRC
#     server), Services will check via the timestamp field whether a user
#     is the same as the last user who identified for the nick, and allow
#     the user access to that nick without requiring identification again
#     if the timestamps match.  Enabling this option will force all users
#     to re-identify after a netsplit.
#
#     Normally, it's easier on users to leave this disabled, but if you
#     suspect one of your servers has been hacked to send false timestamps
#     (or you suspect a bug in Services itself) enabling this directive
#     will eliminate the possibility of one user "stealing" another's nick
#     by pretending to have the same timestamp.
#
#     You may also want to uncomment this directive if your servers' clocks
#     are very far apart; the less synchronized the servers' clocks are,
#     the greater the possibility of someone "taking over" another person's
#     nick when a server with a fast clock splits (though the likelihood of
#     success is relatively small in any case).

#NoSplitRecovery

# ListOpersOnly  [DEPRECATED]
#     When enabled, limits use of the ChanServ and NickServ LIST commands
#     to IRC operators.
#
#     This directive has been superseded by the NSListOpersOnly and
#     CSListOpersOnly directives.

#ListOpersOnly

# BadPassLimit <count>  [RECOMMENDED]
#     Sets the number of invalid password tries before Services removes a
#     user from the network.  If a user enters <count> invalid passwords
#     for any Services function or combination of functions during a
#     single IRC session (subect to BadPassTimeout, below), Services will
#     issue a /KILL for the user.  If not given, Services will ignore
#     failed password attempts (though they will be logged in any case).

BadPassLimit	5

# BadPassTimeout <time>  [OPTIONAL]
#     Sets the time after which invalid passwords are forgotten about.  If
#     a user does not enter any incorrect passwords in this amount of time,
#     the incorrect password count will reset to zero.  If not given, the
#     timeout will be disabled, and the incorrect password count will never
#     be reset until the user disconnects.

BadPassTimeout	1h

# UpdateTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the delay between automatic database updates.  This timer is
#     reset by the OperServ UPDATE command.

UpdateTimeout	5m

# ExpireTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the delay between checks for expired nicknames and channels.
#     The OperServ UPDATE command will also cause a check for expiration
#     and reset this timer.

ExpireTimeout	30m

# AuthExpireTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the delay between checks for expired AUTH entries.  AUTH entries are
#     used for email authentiaction of various commands; the AUTH code is
#     emailed to the user and the user must then put that code into services.
#     Unauthenticated commands which must be removed will be checked for as
#     often as you specify here.

AuthExpireTimeout 30m

# ReadTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the timeout period for reading from the network.

ReadTimeout	5s

# WarningTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the interval between sending warning messages for program
#     errors via WALLOPS/GLOBOPS.

WarningTimeout	4h

# TimeoutCheck <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the (maximum) frequency at which the timeout list is checked.
#     This, combined with ReadTimeout above, determine how accurately timed
#     events, such as nick kills, occur; it also determines how much CPU
#     time Services will use doing this.  Higher values will cause less
#     accurate timing but less CPU usage.
#
#     This shouldn't be set any higher than 10 seconds, and 1 second is
#     best if your system is powerful enough (or your network small enough)
#     to handle it.  0 will cause the timeout list to be checked every time
#     through the main loop, which will probably slow down Services too
#     much to be useful on most networks.
#
#     Note that this value is not an absolute limit on the period between
#     checks of the timeout list; the period may be as great as ReadTimeout
#     (above) during periods of inactivity.

TimeoutCheck	3s

# SnoopChan <channel> [OPTIONAL]
#     Specifies a channel which services pseudoclients will PRIVMSG in 
#     order to log significant events.  This channel will obviously
#     have sensitive information sent to it so it should probably be
#     set RESTRICTED.

SnoopChan       "#services"

# ShowSync [OPTIONAL]
#     Show time remaining until database sync when a nick or channel is
#     registered.

ShowSync

# SendmailPath <path> [RECOMMENDED]
#     Specifies the path to your sendmail binary (or equivalent) for use
#     when emailing users their nick and channel passwords.  Comment out
#     to disable this feature.

SendmailPath "/usr/sbin/sendmail"

# AbuseEmail <email> [REQUIRED}
#     Services now sends emails.  Who will deal with abuse enquiries
#     regarding those emails?

AbuseEmail "abuse@yournet.org"

# NetworkName <name> [REQUIRED]
#     The name of your network.  This should be phrased if possible so
#     that it will fit in the sentence "The <name> IRC Network"

NetworkName "Completely Average"

# StrictPassWarn  [RECOMMENDED]
#     Warn users when they give possibly poor/weak passwords for their nicks
#     and channels, but still allow those passwords.  Note: extremely obvious
#     password such as using the nick for a nick password will always be
#     rejected regardless of this directive.

#     Counting from right to left, how many non-wildcard characters must
#     be present in an AutoKill mask for the AutoKill to be accepted by
#     services.  Wild card characters are '*', '?' and '.'.  For example,
#     with this set at 4, an AutoKill on *@*, *?@*, *@*com or *@*.com is
#     not possible, but an AutoKill on *@*a.com would be possible.

AkillWildThresh 4

# KillClonesAkillExpire <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the expiry time for autokills added for hosts that have been
#     killed using the KILLCLONES command.

KillClonesAkillExpire	30m

# WallOper  [OPTIONAL]
#     Causes Services to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS when a user becomes an IRC
#     operator.  Note that this can cause WALLOPS floods when Services
#     first connects to the network.

#WallOper

# WallBadOS  [OPTIONAL]
#     Causes Services to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS if a non-IRC-operator tries
#     to use OperServ.

#WallBadOS

# WallOS...  [OPTIONAL]
#     Cause Services to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS on use of each of the
#     OperServ commands listed.

#WallOSMode
#WallOSClearmodes
#WallOSKick
#WallOSAkill
#WallOSException

# WallAkillExpire  [OPTIONAL]
#     Causes Services to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS whenever an autokill
#     expires.

#WallAkillExpire

# WallExceptionExpire  [OPTIONAL]
#     Causes Services to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS whenever an session limit
#     exception expires.

#WallExceptionExpire

# WallGetpass  [OPTIONAL]
#     Causes Services to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS on use of the NickServ or
#     ChanServ GETPASS command.

WallGetpass

# WallSetpass  [OPTIONAL]
#     Causes Services to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS whenever a Services admin
#     sets a password for a nickname or channel s/he does not normally have
#     privileges to set.

WallSetpass


# LimitSessions  [OPTIONAL]
#     Enables session limiting. Session limiting prevents users from 
#     connecting more than a certain number of times from the same host at the
#     same time - thus preventing most types of cloning. Once a host reaches 
#     it's session limit, all clients attempting to connect from that host 
#     will be killed. Exceptions to the default session limit, which are based 
#     on host names, can be defined via the exception list. It should be noted
#     that session limiting, along with a large exception list, can degrade
#     services' performance. See the source and comments in sessions.c and the
#     online help for more information about session limiting.
#
#     Session limiting is meant to replace the CheckClones and KillClones
#     code. It is therefore highly recommened that they are disabled when
#     session limiting has been enabled.
#
#     NOTE:  This option is not available when STREAMLINED is defined in
#     the Makefile.

#LimitSessions

# DefSessionLimit <limit>  [REQUIRED]
#     Default session limit per host. Once a host reaches it's session limit,
#     all clients attempting to connect from that host will be killed. A value
#     of zero means an unlimited session limit.

DefSessionLimit	3

# MaxSessionLimit <limit>  [REQUIRED]
#     The maximum session limit that may be set for a host in an exception.

MaxSessionLimit 100

# ExceptionExpiry <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the default expiry time for exceptions.

ExceptionExpiry	1d

# SessionLimitExceeded <message>  [OPTIONAL]
#     The message that will be NOTICE'd to a user just before they are removed
#     from the network because their's host session-limit has been exceeded. 
#     It may be used to give a slightly more descriptive reason for the
#     impending kill as apposed to simply "Session limit exceeded". If this is
#     commented out, nothing will be sent.

SessionLimitExceeded "The session limit for your host %s has been exceeded."

# SessionLimitDetailsLoc <message>  [OPTIONAL]
#     Same as above, but should be used to provide a website address where
#     users can find out more about session limits and how to go about 
#     applying for an exception. If this is commented out, nothing will be
#     sent.
#
#     This option has been intentionally commented out in an effort to remind
#     you to change the URL it contains. It is recommended that you supply an
#     address/url where people can get help regarding session limits.

#SessionLimitDetailsLoc "Please visit http://your.website.url/ for more information about session limits."

# SessionKillClues <count>  [OPTIONAL]
#     How many times to kill for session limit exceeds before applying an
#     AutoKill on the offending host.  If this is unset, or set to 0, no
#     AutoKills will be applied.

SessionKillClues 2

# SessionAkillExpiry <time>  [OPTIONAL]
#     How long should AutoKills for exceeding session limits last?  If
#     not specified the default AutoKill time will be used.

SessionAkillExpiry 6h

# DefaultCloak <string> [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the DefaultCloak Domain.  Omit leading and trailing Dot!
#     Will be used in SET CLOAK ON, sets default cloak to  nick.DefaultCloak

DefaultCloak "user.example.net"

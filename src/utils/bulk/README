Blitzed Services Bulk Registration Tools
----------------------------------------

$Id$

In this directory you will find some tools to make it easier to bulk-register
nicks and channels.  We (Blitzed) find these tools useful in situations such
as:

- A channel based around a large web forum is founded, and the owner of the
  forum/channel wishes for all their forum users to have the same IRC nick and
  password as their forum name and password.  This is often desirable because
  a) it makes it easier on the users, and b) it stops IRC-smart forum users
  from preregistering all the other users' nicks.

- Another IRC network with services is assimilated.  If there is already code
  to bulk-register nicks and channels, then only the code to read the existing
  network's databases needs to be written.

I'm sure you can think of more uses.

All of the scripts accept the command line option --help to give you a brief
usage overview.  register_nick.pl and register_chan.pl also have some variables
that you may want to change if you don't use the same default nick/chan
settings that Blitzed uses.  Patches to make these scripts read services.conf
are welcome.

If you have any further questions or suggestions about these scripts, please
contact services@lists.blitzed.org.

register_nick.pl
----------------

Expects nick details to be sent on STDIN, in this format:

nickname	password	email

The above data is separated by tabs.  "password" is in clear text.  "email" is
optional, but will produce a warning if missed off.  If a given nickname is
already registered, this script will warn and skip that nick.


register_chan.pl
----------------

Expects channel details to be sent on STDIN, in this format:

#channel	founder		password	description

The above data is separated by tabs.  "password is in clear text.
"description" continues until end of line.  If a given channel is already
registered, this script will warn and skip that channel.

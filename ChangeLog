2002-09-06 13:26  andy

	* src/mysql.c:
	
	Quick check to stop people running services with mysql 3.x.  Really
	something needs to go in configure.in.

2002-09-06 11:54  andy

	* src/akill.c:
	
	Fix typo - need to check for @ character in row[1] not row[0]! 
	This will fix bug where akills seem to never be expired.

2002-09-02 03:08  andy

	* src/users.c:
	
	Must only update last_seen/last_quit stuff if the *real_id* is
	identified, not the nick_id.  Spotted by Silencer.

2002-09-02 00:37  andy

	Fix broken "nick is link" message.

2002-08-14 07:50  andy

2002-08-09 16:19  andy

	* configure, configure.in:
	
	up version

2002-08-08 15:30  andy

	* src/: channels.c, chanserv.c, extern.h, services.h:
	
	autolimit and clearbans code rewritten to use only online channel
	data.  autolimit and clearbans data now stored in Channel
	structure, updated on channel creation, destruction, or when
	settings are changed.

2002-08-06 21:33  andy

	* configure, configure.in:
	
	Up version

2002-08-06 19:00  andy

	* src/: extern.h, nickserv.c, users.c:
	
	mysql_update_last_seen() is a better name for
	mysql_identify_nick(), especially because now it needs to set
	different nick status, not just NS_IDENTIFIED.

2002-08-06 18:49  andy

	* src/: extern.h, nickserv.c, users.c, lang/en_us.l, lang/index:
	
	Don't let people link a nick that already has links, to another
	nick.
	
	mysql_identify_nick() function added to centralise code that
	updates the "last seen" columns (last_seen, last_usermask, etc.).
	
	Update "last seen" stuff when someone changes nick to one of their
	linked nicks.

2002-08-06 18:45  andy

	* src/chanserv.c:
	
	Tracked down the source of spurious "out of sync" errors: parts of
	chanserv access list/view do row by row queries and send notices
	inside the while loop.	notice_lang() will do an SQL query if the
	nick cache is out of date or not present for that nick.  To fix
	this, the cache needs to be updated for that nick before hand.

2002-08-01 12:32  andy

	* configure, configure.in, src/mysql.c:
	
	Temporarily turn SQL logging on all the time to try and find a bug.

2002-07-28 00:27  andy

	* configure, configure.in, src/chanserv.c:
	
	Allow non-id'd nicks to id for channels again.	(OK you convinced
	me Andryan)

2002-07-27 10:36  andy

	* src/chanserv.c:
	
	Make sure people are id'd to a nick before they can id to a channel

	found and fixed SQL syntax error when there is 1 unread memo and
	check_memo() is called.

	* src/lang/en_us.l:
	
	Add missing LOGSQL help.

2002-07-23 00:59  phil

	* src/lang/en_us.l:
	
	Fixed CHANSERV and NICKSERV password retrieval e-mails to use
	PASSWORD rather than PASS in the example SET command.

2002-07-22 21:49  andy

	* configure, configure.in, src/chanserv.c:

	src/lang/index:
	
	Add ability to turn mysql logging on and off.

	* src/: extern.h, messages.c, operserv.c:
	
	Remove list of "people available to retrieve passwords" from the

	messages.c, mysql.c, news.c, nickserv.c, operserv.c, rotatelogs.sh,
	sessions.c, lang/en_us.l:
	
	Added logging of SQL queries, logfile to be cycled when SIGUSR2 is
	caught.
	
	Removed all references to "read only" mode as it isn't used
	anymore.

	Updated autoconf and automake stuff to work with 2.53/1.6.  Added
	new configure option --with-extra-fascism wqhich enables all the
	extra gcc3 warning flags I use that aren't generally needed.

	SVSJOIN after SVSMODE +r.

2002-07-15 14:29  andy

	* src/: autojoin.c, extern.h, users.c:
	
	AutoJoin can now automatically invite you through modes +bikl as

2002-07-14 08:27  andy

	* src/: autojoin.c, chanserv.c, extern.h, nickserv.c:
	
	/ns AutoJoin implemented.  Basic features at the moment, simply
	joins you to all channels in your autojoin list that you aren't
	currently on, each time you ID.  Care is taken to remove channels
	from autojoin list when they are dropped or expire.

2002-07-14 07:05  andy

	* data/example.conf, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	src/autojoin.c, src/config.c, src/extern.h, src/nickserv.c,
	src/lang/en_us.l, src/lang/index:
	
	Management of autojoin list implemented.  List still doesn't do
	anything though.

2002-07-14 03:48  andy

	* data/example.conf, src/config.c, src/extern.h, src/nickserv.c,
	src/services.h, src/lang/en_us.l, src/lang/index:

	mysql/blitzed.sql:	New SQL setup taking into consideration
	recent database changes.  TODO: 	SQLINE stuff is done now!

2002-07-13 01:29  andy

	* src/chanserv.c:
	
	A bit of AKICK functionality that I completely forgot about: the
	ability to delete akicks by giving the mask.  Not a biggie, since
	only silly people delete by mask (doing it by index number is
	easier and faster).

2002-07-13 00:56  andy

	* src/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, channels.c, extern.h, messages.c,
	operserv.c, quarantine.c, services.h, users.c, lang/en_us.l,
	lang/index:
	
	Quarantine support added.  Quarantines are implemented via bahamut
	SQLINEs.  Services now learns SQLINEs from the network and adds
	them to the internal Quarantine list.
	
	All SQLINE manipulation should be done via the /os QUARANTINE
	command.  ADD results in an SQLINE being sent to the network, DEL
	sends UNSQLINE.  Added Quarantine regular expressions are compiled
	and discarded on error.

2002-07-13 00:56  andy

	* src/quarantine.c:
	
	file quarantine.c was initially added on branch
	REL-2-0-16-ANDY-SQL.

2002-07-12 02:25  andy

	* src/mysql.c:
	
	Added some startup checks for the required MySQL user-defined
	functions IRC_MATCH() and SHA1() so that services will bail if they
	are not present and working.

2002-07-11 12:01  andy

	* src/: channels.c, chanserv.c, extern.h:
	
	TOPICLOCK to only come into effect when the topic is set by someone
	who could not have used /cs TOPIC instead.

2002-07-11 11:10  andy

	* src/: nickserv.c, services.h, users.c, lang/en_us.l, lang/index:
	
	Add a last quit time field to nickserv info (only shown if quit
	messages are).	Request by IZS.  Also changed a few localtime() to
	gmtime().

2002-07-11 10:13  andy

	* src/: chanserv.c, lang/en_us.l, lang/index:
	
	Show what last matched each akick in the akick view output. 
	Request by dg.

2002-07-11 08:39  andy

	SVSKILL for REGAIN.  Some TODO changes.

2002-07-11 08:26  andy

	Path updates

2002-07-11 08:02  andy

	* src/lang/langcomp.c:

	Merging in changes from SQL-AUTOCONF branch.  Briefly:
	
	- Directory structure has been made more sane, with db2mysql, lang
	and   cracklib falling under src.
	
	- All of services core, all of db2mysql, and parts of lang and
	cracklib   have been converted to use autoconf/automake.
	
	- configure now tries to autodetect MySQL and SSL libs/includes
	(yay!)
	
	- Many of the more bizarre Andrew Church config tests have been
	thrown out   but will probably reappear as needed if ever I find a
	system that needs   them.
	
	- Services will now install into more directories, each of which is
	tunable   with configure options (see ./configure --help).  They
	are:	   o $prefix/bin	   Binaries	   o $prefix/share 
	       Language files, example conf,			      
	cracklib dicts	o $prefix/var/log	Services logfiles	o
	$prefix/etc	      services.conf
	
	TODO:
	
	- An overhaul of command line options is needed, probably with
	getopt, and   decisions made on what can be set at runtime or only
	at compile time.
	
	- Better automake support for cracklib and lang, which is currently
	beyond	 me.
	
	Hope you all enjoy this huge commit email as much as I enjoyed
	having my head fucked backwards with a blunt spork by autoconf for
	the last 18 hours.

2002-05-17 02:02  andy

	Here's AKICK ADD and COUNT

	row from the  chanaccess table.  ACCESS DEL command implemented,

	now takes an	    unsigned int instead of an int.
	
	misc.c: 	process_numlist() reformatted.

2002-05-07 09:29  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Here's a working ACCESS VIEW, plus fixed get_chanaccess_level to
	update last_used time.

2002-05-07 07:42  andy

	* Makefile, actions.c, akill.c, auth.c, cache.c, channels.c,
	chanserv.c, defs.h, extern.h, memory.c, messages.c, mysql.c,
	nickserv.c, services.h:
	
	Makefile:	Extra debugging during development.
	
	defs.h: 	Macros to help shut up warnings about rcsid being
	unused.
	
	actions.c: akill.c: auth.c: cache.c:	Use RCSID macro to shut up
	warnings.
	
	channels.c:	Use RCSID macro to shut up warnings.
	
		findchan_by_id() finds Channel structure given a
	channel_id.
	
		source parameter of do_topic removed since it is
	unnecessary.

	do_set_password() converted to SQL.

2002-04-18 02:24  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	do_set_successor() converted to SQL

2002-04-18 01:35  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	typo

2002-04-17 05:14  andy

	* chanserv.c, extern.h, mysql.c, nickserv.c, services.h:
	
	chanserv.c:	Rewrote count_chans_reged_by() to take account of
	channels      registered by linked nicks.
	
		Removed check_channel_flags() since its fucntionality is
	duplicated
		in get_chan_flags(), changed all occurences.
	
	extern.h:	check_chunk() from mysql.c needs to be extern now
	so that it can be     called from elsewhere (count_chans_reged_by()
	uses it now).
	
	mysql.c:	Remove static scope from check_chunk().
	
	nickserv.c:	Missed an instance of check_channel_limit() which
	has now been  renamed to check_chan_limit() for consistency.
	
	services.h:	channelmax member of NickInfo moved further up to
	indicate that it      is now a property of the master nick only.

2002-04-17 03:00  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Some consistency in function names

2002-04-17 02:56  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	check_channel_limit() now calls two other functions,
	get_channelmax() and count_chans_reged_by().
	
	do_set() converted to use SQL, but only one sub function,
	do_set_founder() converted so far.

2002-04-16 06:12  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	do_drop(), make sure flags is initialised.

2002-04-16 06:09  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	And here's chanserv DROP converted to MySQL.

2002-04-16 05:59  andy

	* chanserv.c, nickserv.c, services.h:
	
	No need to store "channelcount" in the database, it can easily be
	obtained via a query.  So check_channel_limit() modified to perform
	the query, everything else modified to use check_channel_limit(). 
	This saves us having to keep incrementing and decrementing the
	channel count.

2002-04-16 05:24  andy

	* chanserv.c, services.h:
	
	chanserv.c:	Tidy up some prototypes.
	
		Coding standard and typo fixes in check_kick().
	
		Typo fixes in restore_topic().
	
		Make do_register() set all the correct values in the
	ChannelInfo
		before passing to insert_new_channel().
	
		insert_new_channel() now clearer, and sets all values from
	the
		ChanelInfo
	
		do_indentify now complaint with coding standards and
	converted to
		use SQL.
	
		Remove old check_chan_password() routine.
	
		Fixed several typos in get_entrymsg().
	
	services.h:	Added some missing members to ChannelInfo
	structure, and tidying of     comments.

2002-04-16 02:56  andy

	* chanserv.c, main.c:
	
	Oops, broke SIGHUP behaviour.

2002-04-16 00:51  andy

	* actions.c, akill.c, channels.c, commands.c, compat.c,
	datafiles.c, helpserv.c, ircmacros.c, language.c, log.c, memory.c,
	memoserv.c, messages.c, mysql.c, news.c, operserv.c, process.c,
	send.c, servers.c, sessions.c, sockutil.c, timeout.c, users.c,
	vsnprintf.c:
	
	Lots of missed rcsid lines!

2002-04-16 00:38  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	somehow forgot the rcsid

2002-04-16 00:34  andy

	* services.h:
	
	Some structures reorganised and useless members removed

2002-04-16 00:33  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	Removed findnick, getlink which have been replaced with mysql
	versions, or are no longer needed.

2002-04-16 00:07  andy

	* main.c:
	
	Remove chanserv db saving and supporting code.

2002-04-16 00:06  andy

	* init.c:
	
	Remove chanserv db loading, as it's now coming from SQL.

2002-04-16 00:05  andy

	* akill.c, channels.c, chanserv.c, extern.h, memoserv.c,
	operserv.c, users.c:
	
	Minimum amount of changes required to get a skeleton chanserv
	functioning.  Currently only chanserv register actually works.

2002-04-10 08:44  andy

	* nickserv.c, services.h:
	
	NickServ SET SENDPASS command added, can be set to ON or OFF to
	enable or disable SENDPASS on a per-nick basis.  Added nick flag
	NOSENDPASS and added info display for admins and user only. 
	Suggestion from Tom Gilder <tom@tom.me.uk>

2002-04-10 08:40  andy

	* misc.c:
	
	strtolower(), strtoupper(): gcc3 complained about possibly
	undefined behaviour so I took the opportunity to simplify this.

2002-04-10 06:24  andy

	* data/example.conf:
	
	New config option AuthExpireTimeout

2002-04-10 06:23  andy

	* version.sh:
	
	Copyright notice updates

2002-04-10 06:23  andy

	* misc.c:
	
	validate_password(): There's no need to check their registered nick
	and links, if they don't have a registered nick.

2002-04-10 06:22  andy

	* Makefile:
	
	OpenSSL libs/include paths don't usually have to be set.
	
	Added ident target I'm working on for packaging releases.

2002-04-10 02:01  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	Implemented idea of Andryan and Tom's to send nick|user@host of
	user requesting sendpass in the auth email.

2002-04-08 06:57  andy

	* init.c:
	
	This is just some temporary signal experimentation

2002-04-08 06:56  andy

	* extern.h, nickserv.c:
	
	nickserv.c:	do_sendpass() modified as per Tom Gilder's
	suggestions.  That is,	     users are now allowed to use sendpass.
	 This generates an AUTH code	 which is mailed to the user's
	registered email.  After they come	  back and fill in the AUTH
	code, they are assigned a new random  password as before and this
	is mailed to them.
	
		This has been done so that users can request their password
		themselves (especially via a link on the web site), but it
	does
		not end up resetting the user's password until they
	authroise it.

2002-04-08 06:52  andy

	* config.c:
	
	Added AuthExpireTimeout config parameter, to control how often the
	Auth expire loop runs

2002-04-08 06:51  andy

	* auth.c:
	
	file auth.c was initially added on branch REL-2-0-16-ANDY-SQL.

2002-04-08 06:51  andy

	* Makefile, auth.c, main.c:
	
	main.c: 	Some cleanups of main loop, added section to
	periodically call  expire_auth() Makefile, auth.c:	   Routines
	related to auth codes.	Just one routine so far;      
	expire_auth().	This one runs every AuthExpireTimeout and checks   
	    for any auth entries more than 24hrs old.

2002-04-06 03:53  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	Fixed lots of nick escaping problems, which caused services to
	crash whenever someone used a nick with \ in it.  Found by Tom
	Gilder <tom@tom.me.uk>

2002-04-06 03:48  andy

	* extern.h, misc.c, mysql.c:
	
	misc.c, extern.h:	New fatal_error() function provides for
	SQUITting from the network	and dumping core in order to give a
	backtrace.
	
	mysql.c:	Use new fatal_error() function to make tracking
	down MySQL problems	easier.

2002-04-05 23:49  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	Don't free_nickinfo() if the ni has not been populated!

2002-03-29 11:55  andy

	* nickserv.c:

2002-03-28 07:08  andy

	* Makefile, config.c, messages.c, nickserv.c, data/example.conf:
	
	Makefile:	misc.o now depends on a cracklib header I added.
	
	config.c, messages.c, data/example.conf:	Remove NSNeedMail
	as a config option as it is now pointless - we	      always
	require email addresses.
	
	nickserv.c:	Modified do_register() to send an "AUTH" code in
	email, instead of      immediately registering the nick.  The
	pending AUTH codes are kept in	 the auth MySQL table, the code
	itself being formed from a SHA1 hash of  the nickname and a random
	string.
	
		It is intended that this mechanism be used for other
	"sensitive"
		operations, so I have tried to make it generic.  When a
	nick
		register is attempted, the AUTH table is checked to make
	sure that
		nobody else has an AUTH pending.  Assuming they don't, a
	row is
		inserted and a mail containing the code is sent out.
	
		The AUTH option to the REGISTER command is used to finalise
	the
		nick registration.  It first checks the codes match, and
	then
		completes the registration as normal, finally removing the
	row from
		the auth table.
	
		It is intended that rows be purged from the auth table
	every 24
		hours, though I have not decided yet if that should be part
	of
		services or not.
	
	lang/index, lang/en_us.l:	Various strings for the above
	functionality.	Note that the email	  with the AUTh code for
	registering a nick can only be sent in	 services default language,
	because at the time it is sent the user      has no registered nick
	(and therefore no language settings)
	
	cracklib/cracklib/fascist.c:	Moved #defines for messages out to
	separate header.
	
	cracklib/.cvsignore:	Seems to make a file called "installed"
	whcih can be ignored.

	More uses of validate_email to come.

2002-03-27 07:16  andy

	* extern.h, misc.c:
	
	misc.c: 	validate_password() runs a series of checks on a
	password to test       its strength.  Checks implemented:	   
	   - must not equal current nickname		   - must not equal
	ident/username		       - must not equal real name	   
	   - must not equal any of the user's linked nicks		  
	- must not equal channel name (for channels only)		-
	must not equal password of nick or any linked nick (for 	   
	    channels only)		  - must not equal the pasword of
	any of the user's other 		  channels (for channels
	only)  via Alec Muffet's cracklib:	       - must be 5+
	characters long 	   - must have varied characters	  
	- must not match any well known patterns (e.g. 123456,		 
	qwerty, and so on)	      - must not look like a National
	Insurance/Social Security		  number		-
	must not be a dictionary word or simple variation of one	   
	  - must not be a reversed dictionary word or simple		   
	variation of one.

2002-03-27 03:22  andy

	* Makefile, configure:
	
	First stab at importing Alec Muffet's cracklib sources.  I'll be

2002-03-21 17:33  andy

	* config.h, init.c, misc.c, nickserv.c, services.h:
	
	nickserv.c:	Modified to use a 16 character long random salt for
	passwords.  config.h:	    SALTMAX to account for salt length. 
	init.c:    Move setting of random seed to here.  Doing it inside  
	make_random_string() meant that calling that function twice within 
	    same second led to identical strings being created.  Maybe we  
	should use a better rand() function? misc.c:	As above. 
	services.h:  NickInfo fields for salt and last_sendpass_salt. 
	lang/en_us.l:	      Give out the salt on a getpass.

	default hostmark is set to 0 [14:36:19] <tom> it should be 1 I
	think?

2002-03-20 06:05  andy

	* config.h, extern.h, misc.c, nickserv.c, services.h:
	
	config.h:	PASSMAX set to 41, as SHA1 digests are 40 bytes
	when represented	in hex.
	
	extern.h:	Prototype for make_random_string.
	
	misc.c: 	make_random_string() fills a buffer with random
	alphabetical	characters, for use in generating new passwords.
	
	nickserv.c:	do_sendpass() modified to use SHA1 hashed password.
	 Now generates	    a new password and sets that, mails it to the
	user.  The old hash	  is saved in the last_sendpass_pass column
	for audit purposes.
	
	services.h:	Two more NickInfo fields, last_sendpass_pass holds
	the password	     hash that was current when sendpass was last
	used,	   last_sendpass_time is the timestamp of the last sendpass
	usage.
	
	lang/en_us.l:	Updated the nick SENDPASS text to reflect new
	behaviour.

	Here's a quick SHA1 function using OpenSSL.  Really doesn't seem
	worth reinventing the wheel on this one, especially when I am not a
	crypto expert, so I'll leave it to those who are.

2002-03-20 04:42  andy

	* mysql/: blitzed_udf.c, make:
	
	Added new SHA1 MySQl function, for computing SHA-1
	cryptographically secure message digests.  This is the algorithm
	we'll use for services passwords, mainly because it is not
	soemthing that every kiddie password cracking tool has built in. 
	To brute force this they will require a modicum of clue.
	
	Benchmark suggests it is also twice as fast as the MD5 routine that
	is bundles with MySQL, though this could well be because the MD5
	routine is actually more secure (if it uses salts etc.).

2002-03-19 16:58  andy

	* nickserv.c, cache.c, extern.h:
	
	do_identify():	Now flushes the nick cache every time the nick is

	This code forms a MySQL user-defined function IRC_MATCH() to do
	IRC-style wildcard matching on strings from within MySQL. 
	Instructions for installation are currently inside blitzed_udf.c.

2002-03-08 06:00  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	do_access():	DEL now needs the nickaccess table to be write
	locked.  This is	 because we have one query deleting entries
	and then another     renumbering every row for a given nick.  If
	another modification	    were to happen between the two (say
	from a web site) then there is	    scope for entries to get
	completely jumbled or for services to  crash.

2002-03-08 05:52  andy

	* mysql.c:
	
	mysql_simple_query():	Add logging simple queries too.  This
	function is really badly  named actually - you have to handle all
	the errors yourself, and	work out whether the query should
	have returned rows etc.  Not  simple at all, just "unmanaged".

2002-03-08 05:50  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	mysql_renumber_nick_access():	Renumber the idx column for a given
	nick's access list in order to	    remove gaps after entries are
	deleted.

2002-03-08 04:24  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	After discussion with tom have decided that I really need to keep
	an index in every list per user or channel or whatever.  For
	example, the nickaccess table holds every user's nick access list
	entries so the row IDs alone will not be contiguous for any given
	user.
	
	So, here is the start of my plan to add an index column into every
	table that is holding "list" data.
	
	do_access():	LIST now displays the access index rather than the
	internal row ID.     ADD now inserts an incremented index.

2002-01-31 10:03  andy

	* Makefile, chanserv.c, configure, encrypt.c, encrypt.h,
	nickserv.c, pseudo.h, services.h:
	
	Removed encrypt.c, encrypt.h and all encryption code as it has
	never been used and does not make sense for it ever to be used.
	
	chanserv.c:	check_channel_password()		Check a
	user's supplied channel apssword against the		founder
	pass.

	* Makefile, chanserv.c, config.c, config.h, main.c, operserv.c,
	users.c:
	
	Remove #defines for STREAMLINED mode, which we never have used and
	never will use.

2002-01-31 04:33  andy

	* Makefile, cache.c, extern.h, language.c, main.c, nickserv.c:
	
	cache.c:	Added a "nick cache" which holds certain
	information about each	       nick which is either private to
	services (nick status) or is rarely	changed but often used
	(language setting).  Caching these values	 within services
	saves many many MySQL queries.
	
		The overall design is an array of circularly linked lists
	holding
		the heads of each hash chain, as the nicks are hashed they
	are
		added onto the end of the relevant chain.
	
		Each structure holds the nick_id, the status and the
	language, and
		a timestamp for each of status and language.  The hash
	needs to be
		updated every time a change is made from services, and is
	also
		updated if the data is ever more than an hour out of date.
	
		Currently this file contains only nickcache routines and
		structures.  As ChanServ is converted to SQL, chancache
	structures
		and routines will be added.
	
		nickcache_init()
			Initialise each chain with a zero'd structure as
	its head.
	
		nickcache_delall()
			Free up the entire hash prior to services exit.
	
		nickcache_insert()
			Insert an up-to-date entry into the cache for the
	specified
			nick requesting the data from MySQL.
	
		dump_cache_chain()
			Debug function which lists all the nicks on a cache
	chain.
	
		nickcache_find()
			Return a pointer to the nickcache structure for the
	given
			nick_id.  If it is not found, a new one is inserted
	using
			nickcache_insert() abive, and a pointer to this
	returned.
	
		nickcache_del()
			Remove an entry from the nickcache.  In practice
	only used
			when a nick ceases to exist in MySQL.
	
		nickcache_update()
			Updates the entire contents of the nickcache entry
	for the
			given nick.  The logic being that it is the setting
	up of
			the MySQL query that is expensive, so we may as
	well get
			all the data we want each time.
	
		nickcache_get_language()
			Return a given nick's language from the cache.
	
		nickcache_set_language()
			Set a given nick's language in the cache, adding
	them an
			entry if there is none present already.
	
		nickcache_get_status()
			Return a given nick's status.
	
		nickcache_set_status()
			Set a given nick's status, adding an entry if there
	is not
			one already.
	
		nickcache_add_status()
			Add a status to the status that a nick already has,
			inserting a new entry into the cache if there is
	not one
			present already.
	
		nickcache_remove_status()
			Remove a status from the status that a given nick
	already
			has, inserting a new entry into the cache if there
	is not
			one present already.
	Makefile:	Added file cache.c
	
	language.c:	Retrieve language settings from the nickcache
	instead of MySQL.
	
	main.c: 	Delete the nickcache at shutdown.
	
	nickserv.c:	During ns_init, also clear regainid, and initialise
	nickcache.
	
		Almost all status readings are now taken from nickcache,
	with
		status changes updating the cache.  Same goes for language
		settings.

	* mysql.c:
	
	handle_mysql_error()	Generates a hopefully informative error
	string then terminates	services.
	
	smysql_bulk_query()	Takes a formatted mysql query and executes
	it, then fetches all the     data at once, returning a result

	when finished.
	
	smysql_query()	Takes a formatted mysql query and executes it, uses
	the result and	    returns the result pointer.  The caller should

	file mysql.c was initially added on branch REL-2-0-16-ANDY-SQL.

2001-12-16 10:36  andy

	* version.sh:
	
	This is 2.0.16

	* chanserv.c, nickserv.c:
	
	Added ChanServ SET REGTIME in the same fashion as NickServ SET
	REGTIME.  Spotted missing return; in nickserv code that would have
	allowde any user to use SET REGTIME :-)

2001-12-12 12:03  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Some much needed updating of ChanServ SET MLOCK help.
	
	ChanServ SET MLOCK syntax enforced more stringently now; to remove
	MLOCK you must use + or OFF, anything else produces syntax_error().

2001-12-12 09:18  andy

	* chanserv.c, nickserv.c:
	
	Inform snoop channel about how many nicks/channels have expired. 
	Suggested by Silencer <andryan@softhome.net>

2001-12-12 08:50  andy

	* services.h:
	
	Increase database version.
	
	bantime added to Channel structure.

2001-12-12 08:47  andy

	* extern.h:
	
	New prototypes for ChanServ SET CLEARBANS

2001-12-12 08:46  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	do_set_clearbans() added to handle configuration of the new SET
	CLEARBANS option.
	
	Database version increased to 11, reading an earlier database sets
	bantime to 0 (disabled) by default.
	
	Conversions from old char **bans list to new Ban **bans list.

2001-12-12 08:43  andy

	* channels.c:
	
	Convert to using Ban structure instead of char * for channel bans,
	this was necessary so that we could record the time at which each
	ban was placed, which in turn was necessary so that we can expire
	them after a certain amount of time.
	
	chan_update_autolimits() generalised to chan_update_events(), as it
	now applies to both limits and ban expiry.
	
	chan_check_clearbans() to check if a given channel has any bans
	which must be expired.

2001-12-12 08:37  andy

	* akill.c, news.c, nickserv.c, sessions.c:
	
	Increase file version for new db format

2001-12-08 14:08  andy

	* nickserv.c:

	segfault.

2001-12-08 04:10  andy

	* channels.c, chanserv.c:
	
	Make tolerance only apply for raising the limit, not lowering it.

	Updated for 2.0.14 release

2001-11-29 20:08  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	Typo.

2001-11-29 09:57  andy

	* nickserv.c, services.h:
	
	do_set_regtime: allow services admins to change the nick
	registration time or arbitrary nicks.  Logs, globops and snoop to
	prevent abuse.
	
	do_regain: fixed security problem by recording unique services
	stamp of the user issuing the command.	Only this user may regain
	the nick.  ni->regainid added to store this info in.

2001-11-29 08:19  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Cleared up this akick view format, too difficult to do it all in
	one line and internationalise it correctly.

2001-10-27 17:10  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	get_chanaccess can return NULL, which will cause services to
	segfault on start when it does
	
	last_read_time = access->memo_read;
	
	:(

2001-09-29 04:12  andy

	* ChangeLog, README, version.sh:
	
	Updated changelogs and readme for new release, and now we're into
	2.0.14.

2001-09-16 06:34  andy

	* akill.c:
	
	AKILL DEL extensions complete.

2001-09-16 05:13  andy

	* akill.c:
	
	AKILL ADD extensions complete.

2001-09-16 05:12  andy

	* misc.c:
	
	produce a smaller string when only hours are specified (which is
	common)

2001-09-16 03:21  andy

	* akill.c, extern.h, operserv.c, users.c:
	
	Now counts and displays how many people will be affected by an
	akill.	At this stage any oper can use akill.

2001-09-12 17:11  andy

	* chanserv.c, extern.h, memoserv.c:
	
	We don't need the MemoInfo after all..

2001-09-12 16:47  andy

	* chanserv.c, services.h:
	
	New channel access level AKICK-LIST to allow people to list or view
	the channel akicks without letting them set or delete them.

2001-09-12 15:55  andy

	* chanserv.c, memoserv.c, services.h:
	
	Created a new level setting: CA_MEMO_SEND; the access level
	required for sending memos to a channel.  Renamed CA_MEMO to
	CA_MEMO_READ, this still applies to reading and listing memos.
	
	Previously any registered nick could send a memo to a channel.	Now
	the default is any user with 1+ access in the channel.	Old
	behaviour can be obtained by setting the level required to zero.

2001-09-12 14:28  andy

	* chanserv.c, memoserv.c:
	
	When someone sends a memo to a channel, users inside the channel
	with enough access are sent a notice:
	
	-MemoServ(services@blitzed.org)- griff has sent a memo to #blitzed.

2001-09-12 13:27  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	1. If we have no info about when someone last read channel memos,
	then it should be set to 0.
	
	2.  Memoserv should send the notice about new channel memos.

2001-09-10 23:55  andy

	* chanserv.c, extern.h, users.c:
	
	Doh, really must learn my pointers :)

2001-09-10 18:56  andy

	* chanserv.c, extern.h, memoserv.c, services.h, users.c:
	
	Haven't had time to test this yet, but it compiles!  :)
	
	Will check when I get home.
	
	Added ci->founder_memo_read as a timestamp of when the channel
	founder last read channel memos.  We now keep track of people
	reading channel memos in their ChanAccess structure, but the
	founder can read memos without having any acess in the channel!  So
	the founder's time needs to be recorded with the main channel
	structure.  This means it will not be accurate if the channel
	changes founders, but oh well.	Some else can implement a data
	structure within nickserv that records when each nick has read the
	memops for each channel if they like.
	
	check_chan_memos is called every time a user joins the channel, it
	checks if they can read memos and then if there are any new memos.
	
	update_memo_time copies the timestamp from the last read memo, to
	the appropriate read timestamp (ci->founder_memo_read or
	access->memo_read)
	
	get_chanaccess does exactly the same as get_access, except that it
	takes a pointer to a ChanAccess and passes it back, as well as the
	integer access level.
	
	new_chan_memos does the actual counting of which channel memos
	haven't been read yet (based on timestamp; we don't have a "read"
	flag for every user that could possibly read a memo)

2001-09-09 14:14  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	ChanServ OP now gives a more informative message if you try to use
	it without being identified to a nick.	Reported by dg.

2001-09-09 13:56  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Extended AKick struct now holds the time the akick was added and
	the time it was last used, chanserv routines modified to update
	these values, and visible from AKICK VIEW.

2001-09-09 13:23  andy

	* chanserv.c, services.h:
	
	ChanAccess extensions finished, also added a time_t for last
	channel memo read time.

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Remove debug comments

2001-09-09 12:33  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Extra ChanAccess data is now updated.
	
	Modified shell_sort_access to use memcopy and memset since
	ChanAccess is a complicated structure now.
	
	Added ACCESS VIEW command to display all this extra data.
	
	Documented ACCESS VIEW and SYNC.

2001-09-09 08:32  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Channel access modification routines now update the correct data in
	the extended ChanAccess strusture.

2001-09-09 07:10  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Added two new helper functions: 	populate_access 	   
	    - Fill a new access list structure with correct data   
	modify_access		- Modify an existing access list structure
	
	These were added because of the duplication of code in
	ACCESS/VOP/AOP/SOP would mean that extending ChanAccess would
	require adding the same code 4 times.  ChanAccess extensions to
	follow.

2001-09-09 06:18  andy

	* akill.c, chanserv.c, news.c, nickserv.c, operserv.c, services.h,

	used	     - who added it  - who last modified it
	
	Extend Akick to include:	- time it was added	- time it
	was last used
	
	Note that none of this is used yet, only the data structures and
	database load/save routines have been modified so far.

2001-09-09 00:26  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Update ci->last_used as long as the user has any access > 0 in the

	#thefalls when it caused their channel to expire, sorry!

2001-09-07 12:19  andy

2001-08-13 03:28  andy

	* chanserv.c, services.h:
	
	A ChanServ SYNCH command that so far removes desynch for channel
	modes and bans (not ops/voices yet).

2001-07-22 01:55  andy

	* messages.c:
	
	Oops, an extra param means we need to move one more thing.

2001-07-22 01:54  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Now that we know the IP of every user we can handle unbans by
	ourselves

2001-07-15 05:24  andy

	* messages.c:
	
	Extra parameter in NICK now

2001-07-15 05:20  andy

	* init.c, send.c, users.c:
	
	We're now capable of NICKIP!  User's IP address is sent as unsigned
	long just before ircname at end of NICK.

2001-07-15 05:18  andy

	* services.h:
	
	Also store user's IP as dot quad string and as struct in_addr

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Fixed disastrous logic error (oops)

2001-05-21 04:25  andy

	* chanserv.c, version.sh:
	
	ChanServ OP now checks the person you are trying to op, if the
	channel has SECURE or SECUREOPS set.
	
	SECURE = only identified nicks may have ops SECUREOPS = only nicks
	on the channel's access list as AOP or higher may have ops
	
	Returns permission denied if they cannot be opped.  Does not affect
	channels that have neither SECURE nor SECUREOPS set.

2001-03-22 22:45  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Fix typo reported to ircservices list which allows people to drop

	More IRC_DALNET's lurking and screwing up akill removal, fixed.

2001-02-25 14:32  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	I missed a bunch of IRC_DALNET #defines which caused ChanServ to
	join channels in order to kick people out :(
	
	Fixed now :)

2001-02-21 23:39  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	Give the correct syntax reply for NickServ REGISTER depending on if
	we need email addresses or not.  Spotted by MetalMickey.

2001-02-15 15:07  andy

	* version.sh:
	
	Upping version number

2001-02-15 14:56  andy

	* ChangeLog, README:
	
	New changes for 2.0.9

2001-02-15 13:36  andy

	* users.c:
	
	This allows you to /nick to one of your linked nicknames and take
	your "temporary status" with you, i.e. if you were identified
	before then you have no need to identify again.

2001-02-15 10:49  andy

	* sessions.c:
	
	Fixed problem where session limit akills couldn't be removed (doh!)

2001-02-15 10:40  andy

	* actions.c, channels.c, chanserv.c, extern.h, messages.c,
	nickserv.c, send.c, services.h, users.c, version.sh:
	
	ChanServ SET OPNOTICE becomes SET VERBOSE, all ChanServ fucntions
	that affect a channel now will send a notice to channel operators
	if VERBOSE is set.
	
	Added support for chanmode +a so that it can be MLOCKed and CLEAR
	MODES affects it correctly.

2001-02-06 17:28  phil

	* messages.c:
	
	
	
	Found the remaining 2000 and changed it to read 2000-2001

2001-02-04 14:07  andy

	* configure, init.c, ircmacros.c, send.c, services.h, version.sh:
	
	Removing support for other ircds

2001-02-04 14:05  andy

	* Makefile:
	
	BSD tar has different options from GNU tar AGH!

2001-02-04 14:01  andy

	* users.c:
	
	SIlly error meant that the first person into a channel was not
	recognized as opped therefore no channels could be registered (!)

2001-02-04 02:59  andy

	* akill.c:
	
	Typo

2001-02-03 14:11  andy

	* users.c:
	
	Dodgy SSJOIN fix :/

2001-01-31 23:02  andy

	* ChangeLog:
	
	Changes for 2.0.7

2001-01-30 11:48  andy

	* channels.c, chanserv.c, extern.h, import-db.c, init.c, main.c,
	memoserv.c, messages.c, misc.c, nickserv.c, operserv.c, process.c,
	services.h, users.c:
	
	Apologies for the size of this patch.
	
	Removed all #defines related to ircd types - we now only support
	Bahamut and our patches to it.
	
	RFC compliant string matching now used (so that nicks and channels
	with []{}\ in them are treated correctly)
	
	Fixed bug where a channel founder whose nick was dropped or expired
	whilst they were also on the channel's access list would leave the
	access list corrupted.
	
	Number of channels registered is now checked on nick link.
	
	Fixed bug where a channel's successor could also be made the
	founder.
	
	Fixed cosmetic bug where setting only +l or +k as a modelock would
	report the modelock as cleared.
	
	ChanServ UNBAN cleaned up now I know it works.
	
	Fixed bug where ChanServ CLEAR MODES wasn't clearing mode +O
	
	In OperServ STATS ALL, the MemoServ database now has separate
	memory usage report (was previously part of NickServ)
	
	Services is now capable of SSJOIN, a more efficient Bahamut command
	for joining multiple users to a channel.
	
	Sending Services a USR2 signal now causes the logfiles to be closed
	and then reopened.  This is necessary for log rotation scripts.
	
	Maximum value allowed in range commands is now 65536.
	
	Mixed time intervals are now allowed (e.g. 1h30m)
	
	Simpler Guest-nick generation algorithm.
	
	Fixed memory leak in process_numlist().
	
	Fixed bug causing invalid effective-nick pointers when a
	link-parent is deleted.
	
	Fixed bug allowing improper privileges with linked nicks.  Reported
	by <r1ch@r1ch.net>
	
	Fixed "Currently online" being shown in NickServ INFO even when the
	user isn't online.
	
	Support for services stamps to enhance split recovery.
	
	Effective nicks are now set correctly upon delink for nested links.
	
	Fixed bug allowing nick takeover on LINK.
	
	Added support for +a user mode (services admin).  Non-services
	admins trying to set this mode will have it taken from them.  This
	still needs some work, but it basically is working okay.
	
	Most of this code is adapted from the new ircservices-4.5pre.

2001-01-28 05:03  andy

	* nickserv.c:
	
	Fixed problem where an oper using a linked nick would be told to
	set ircop on even though they already had.

2001-01-27 12:34  andy

	* akill.c, config.c, extern.h, sessions.c, data/example.conf:
	
	New config option AkillWildThresh to specify the number of
	non-wildcard characters which must be present for an AutoKill to be
	legal, wildcards are '*', '?' and '.'.	e.g. when set to 4 it is
	impossible to akill:
	
		*@*
		*@?*
		*@*com
		*@*.com
	
	but it is possible to akill:
	
		*@*a.com
	
	Cleaned up akill add code to use above parameter.
	
	New config option SessionKillClues to specify how many times users
	from a host may be killed for exceeding session limits before an
	AutoKill is placed.
	
	New config option SessionAkillExpiry to specify how long an akill
	for repeatedly exceeding session limits will last.
	
	Session limiting now uses above parameters to place akills when
	session limits are repeatedly exceeded.
	
	OperServ SESSION LIST now displays the limit as well as the current
	number users for each host.

2001-01-27 04:54  andy

	* memoserv.c:
	
	A previous fix to process_numlist to prevent denial of service had
	left users unable to read their 40th memo.  Also if a services
	admin sent users a memo which took them over their memo limit, they
	were unable to read those memos either.
	
	This has been fixed by sending the largest of their memocount or
	the max memos to process_numlist as the upper bound.

2001-01-27 04:52  andy

	* version.sh:
	
	Upped version

2001-01-27 04:49  andy

	* ChangeLog, README:
	
	Updates for 2.0.6

2001-01-25 20:48  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	Emergency fixes to chanlist stuff.
	
	I'll not try to code after being awake for 2 days again.  Far too
	many stupid errors involving derefrencing null pointers..

2001-01-25 18:59  andy

	* channels.c, chanserv.c, import-wrecked-db.c, nickserv.c,
	operserv.c, services.h, statistics.c, users.c:
	
	Modified ChanServ UNBAN to use SVSMODE command of bahamut.  Now a
	user's local ircd will remove any ban that affects them, so this
	includes bans on IP address now.
	
	Cleaned up the umode and cmode definitions so it is easier to refer
	to both upper case and lower case modes.
	
	Channel mode O (oper-only channel) can now be mlocked properly.

2001-01-25 05:14  andy

	* chanserv.c:
	
	I forgot to add chanlist code to VOP/AOP/SOP.  Lists will be
	incomplete (missing those channels for which VOP/AOP/SOP ADD was
	used) until services is restarted, but it should cause no harm.

2001-01-25 00:55  andy

	* version.sh:
	
	Upped version number

2001-01-25 00:51  andy

	* ChangeLog, README:
	
	Changes for 2.0.5

2001-01-24 23:09  andy

	* chanserv.c, config.c, extern.h, nickserv.c, services.h,
	data/example.conf:
	
	NickServ LISTCHANS added, allows users to list every channel that
	they have access in.  Services admins can specify any nickname.
	
	NSRegExtraInfo config option added.  Optional string which will
	give more information at the time someone registers a nick e.g. how
	to subscribe to a public list.
	
	NickServ LISTLINKS modified to allow users to list links to their
	own nicks.

2001-01-24 07:19  andy

	* extern.h, memoserv.c, nickserv.c, operserv.c, services.h:
	
	MemoServ OPERSEND and CSOPSEND to send memos to all registered
	ircops and services ops respectively.

2001-01-21 22:58  andy

	* akill.c, memoserv.c, nickserv.c:
	
	MemoServ READ now has an "ALL" option to read all memos whether
	previously read or not.
	
	NickServ LIST has an "IRCOP" option to match nicks with the IRCOP
	flag set.
	
	OperServ AKILL VIEW now shows the full date when the akill was
	added.
	
	MemoSERV GLOBALSEND is in the helpfiles but not implemented yet.

2001-01-21 04:02  andy

	* version.sh:
	
	Upped version number

	changes for 2.0.4

2001-01-20 23:44  andy

	* akill.c:
	
	Adding and removing akills now gives a lot more information in
	wallops:
	
		[23:31] -andy-old.freebsd.test.blitzed.org- *** Global --
	from
		OperServ: grifferz added an AKILL for *@asdrfgsdrfgzxedrfz
		(expires in 15 minutes) [test]

	*@asdrfgsdrfgzxedrfz
		(Would have expired in 14 minutes, 58 seconds) [test]
	
		[23:41] -andy-old.freebsd.test.blitzed.org- *** Global --
	from
		OperServ: grifferz added an AKILL for *@asdrfgsdrfgzxedrfz
	(does

2001-01-20 22:31  andy

	* akill.c:
	
	indented for clarity

2001-01-20 21:04  andy

	* users.c:
	
	wallops when max usercount reached.

2001-01-20 09:41  andy

	* chanserv.c, extern.h, main.c, memoserv.c, misc.c, nickserv.c,
	services.h, sessions.c, version.sh:
	
	Fixed denial of service attack where it was possible to specify an
	extremely large range to some commands, e.g.
	
		/msg memoserv del 1-99999999999999999999999
	
	This would cause services to loop until it pinged out.
	
	NickServ REGAIN is now present.

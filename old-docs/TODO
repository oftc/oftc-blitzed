Under development:

NS	CS SUSPEND command.
SS	Addition of more StatServ functionality :)

--------

User suggestions:

NS	Devise a new algorithm to generate Guest nick suffixes so that there is
	    absolutely no chance of two Guests getting the same numeric suffix.
    (Done: is it working 100%? -TheShadow)
**	Periodic pings to uplink server
	    [<fabulous@brasnet.org>]
MS	Command to delete last sent memo if recipient hasn't logged on since
	    [Stefan Funke <bundy@bundynet.de>]
**	Specific exit values for certain things (e.g. failed connection)
OS	Change clone kill functionality; only kill new clones, not all
	    [last 2: <uziel@ingsoc.com>]
    (Obsolete? Superceded by session limiting? -TheShadow)
OS	Command to reset max user count
OS	Option to show nick in JUPE message
	    [<dnar@concentric.net>]
**	Rewrite sgets() not to hang if part of a line received
NS	Numbered access list
CS	Merge appropriate channel flags with LEVELS settings
MS	Function to E-mail memos to an address
NS/CS	SENDPASS to send nick/channel passwords via E-mail
**	Services admin list should be available to normal users
NS	Hash nicknames based on their first two characters, rather than just
	    the first. This would improve findnick() times a lot - according
	    to profiling results it would, that is.

--------

Things to think about:

**	A simpler way of defining known channel modes. e.g It must be easier
	    to add/remove a channel mode from the those that can be mlock'ed.
**	REHASH command (that functions properly!)
NS	Option to set delay time for FORBIDden nicks
	    [Erdem Sener <mikado@holyfire.com>]
    (Solved by SUSPEND? When would FORBID be better than SUSPEND? -TheShadow)
**	/msg * HELP INDEX to list all topics
	    [<pteryx@ime.net>]
NS	Option to require E-mail address with registration
	    [<kieran_spain@eol.ieaust.org.au>]
CS	Option to not show old setter when restoring topic
	    [Pete Ford <pford@ccinu.net>]
NS	Services oper/admin status line in INFO
CS	SET REVENGE (reverses ban, etc. set by lower level user on higher,
		and optionally deops/kicks/bans lower level user)
	    [last 2: <andor@terrax.net>]
MS	Notification for channel memos (on send, on logon?)
CS	Last used time for AKICK
	    [last 2: <fabulous@brasnet.org>]
OS	Last used time for AKILL
NS	SET INFO to set an info line for INFO command (like channel descs)
NS	Show services oper/admin/root status in INFO
**	Module support
	    [last 3: <dnar@terrax.net>]
CS	Notice about NickServ IDENTIFY required for secure privs
NS	SET ALL (especially PASSWORD) for all linked nicks
	    [Travis Saucier <enygma@cyberback.com>]
MS	Require only recognition (not IDENTIFY) for INFO
MS	MemoServ IGNORE {ADD,DEL,LIST}
NS	Link URL/E-mail as well
**	Add SYS_LANGUAGE and language-ify strings for wallops/kills/etc.
OS	Prevent autokills matching everyone (*@*, etc.)
    (Sort of done - we deny the addition of *@* but not *@*.* -TheShadow)
OS	Should CLEARMODES obey regged channels' mode locks?
CS	Allow hiding of INFO information a la NickServ
**	Add a way to send OperServ (and other?) commands from the shell
**	Services log channel
